This Project's task is to utilize Convulutional Nueral Networks to be able to identify if an image is a Dog or a Cat. 

Convolutional Nueral Networks are widely used for image/video dectetion and for classifing data.

What makes Convulutional Nueral Networks special is that they are computationally more efficent.
- This is because they use less parameters than a Standard Fully Connected Nueral Network. 
- There are 3 layes of a Convolutional NN: A Convulution layer(CONV) , a Pooling layer(POOL) and a Fully Connected layer(FC)

Two tasks happen in Conv NN's: 'Feature' Extraction and Classfication
- The most useful aspect of Convulutional NN's are there ability to extract 'features' from data. 
- Features are patterns or characteristics found within the data. 
- During Feature extraction phase, the model is passing the input data through its Convulutional and Pooling layers
- While data is being passed, the model reads the data and tries to determine'features'

After the Feature extration, it is time to classify the data. 
 - This is where the model reads through the data and tries to classify it. 
 - For my project, the model will read through the data input and label it as a Dog or Cat
